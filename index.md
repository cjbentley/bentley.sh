## Hi, I'm Cameron Bentley.

I'm a second year mechanical engineering undergraduate at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. I have a big interest in the automotive industry, as well as in aerospace and software engineering. 

I've worked as a co-op student across Canada in a variety of positions, primarily in the civil engineering and O&G industries. I'm looking forward to broadening my skillset throughout the remainder of my degree with additional co-op placements.

### Projects & Personal Interests
## Mk7 Volkswagen GTI

Over the course of the last few months, I've been working on making a track-capable daily driver. 
Mainly, I'm focused on quality-of-life, safety, and reliability improvements, as my track skill doesn't necessitate adding power, and also I don't want to totally bankrupt myself.

Currently, the car is mostly stock, on Firestone Firehawk Indy 500 tires. I've recently installed a short shifter, and am currently awaiting some R1 GEOMET rotors, EBC Yellowstuff pads, and Motul RBF600 fluid to rework the brakes to withstand track heat cycles, as the Mk7 GTI is renowned for fade under sustained load.

Beyond that, I'm likely going to focus on cooling to ensure reliability under sustained WOT, and perhaps retrofitting dual injection from the European EA888 to help mitigate carbon buildup on the valves - if I'm ambitious enough.

I do all maintenance and modifications myself, and am looking forward to taking this to some local tracks throughout this season.
